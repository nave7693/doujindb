System Requirements
	The latest JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed. You can get it here http://www.java.com/en/
	Some disk space, depending on how much data you're going to save in your datastore.

HowTo
	DoujinDB does not need to be installed on you system, you can just run it once downloaded by (double)clicking on it.
	On some desktop environment you'll have to open a shell and run it from there:
		1. open a shell
		2. move in the dir where "DoujinDB-v$VERSION.jar" is located
		3. type "java -jar DoujinDB-v$VERSION.jar"
	where $VERSION is the number of your downloaded version.
	You can also rename it in "DoujinDB.jar" and run it as "java -jar DoujinDB.jar" as well as create a symlink, depending on your system.
	
	You can customize the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in 2 simple ways:
		1. change color/background_color properties from the settings panel. *
		2. modify the "icons.zip" file (available for download) replacing default icons with your custom ones and putting it in the doujindb resource folder ($USER_HOME/.doujindb/rc). *
		* will require DoujinDB to be restarted.

Notes
	DoujinDB won't run on a headless system.
	It IS recommended to run DoujinDB from a command prompt to troubleshoot problems, since all the logs will be printed on the standard output.
	It's still in beta, so play with it and please report bugs if you find them, it'll help to improve it for you as well as for other users.
